-> at submit time (the last one, when the submission become SURVEY_CLOSED)
       I must cleanup the submission because of this problem:
       at t1: the user answers true to a branching question
       at t2: the user answer the child (via true) question
       at t3: the user returns back and choose false for the branching question
       at t4: then answer the child (via false) question.
       At this stage the db is not correct and needs cleanup.
-> does it make sense the research per label?
-> validate the content of the XML uploaded by the user
-> at uninstall time delete 'mod_survey' files too
-> make a general test as teacher and student too (thanks to JR)
-> * Deletion confirmation date error:
Are you sure you want delete the selected survey owned by John Doe,
created on Sunday, 4 November 2012, 11:09 AM and modified on *Thursday,
1 January 1970, 1:00 AM*? (thanks to JR)
-> The Validate tab should only be displayed if the survey contains
branching questions. (thanks to JR)
-> This has lots of features, but the consequence is that the page is
"cluttered" with too many settings. Obviously a Show/Hide advanced
button is needed. (thanks to JR)
-> ** Required does not work : module refuses to save or submit responses if ALL
questions have not been answered, does not take into account the
"required" setting! (thanks to JR)
-> * folder mod/survey/field should be renamed to /questiontypes  (thanks to JR)
-> *** month values should range from 1 to 12 (not 0 to 11!) (thanks to JR)
-> * Checkbox ** Default does not work (thanks to JR)
-> * Note: it would be useful to have a "manage question types" feature for
this module, similar to the Quiz questions manage question types, so
that an Admin would be able to disable/enable survey question types at
site level. (thanks to JR)
