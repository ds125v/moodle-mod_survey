-> at submit time (the last one, when the submission become SURVEY_CLOSED)
       I must cleanup the submission because of this problem:
       at t1: the user answers true to a branching question
       at t2: the user answer the child (via true) question
       at t3: the user returns back and choose false for the branching question
       at t4: then answer the child (via false) question.
       At this stage the db is not correct and needs cleanup.
-> does it make sense the research per long text?
-> validate the content of the XML uploaded by the user
-> at uninstall time delete 'mod_survey' files too
-> make a general test as teacher and student too (thanks to JR)
-> The Validate tab should only be displayed if the survey contains
branching questions. (thanks to JR)
-> This has lots of features, but the consequence is that the page is
"cluttered" with too many settings. Obviously a Show/Hide advanced
button is needed. (thanks to JR)
-> * folder mod/survey/field should be renamed to /questiontypes  (thanks to JR)
-> * Note: it would be useful to have a "manage question types" feature for
this module, similar to the Quiz questions manage question types, so
that an Admin would be able to disable/enable survey question types at
site level. (thanks to JR)
